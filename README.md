GitHub is an open source version control system. It is used for hosting code for version control and collaboration. It also allows you and other individuals to work together on projects from anywhere.

Task 1:
1.1-Install git and create a GitHub account at https://git-scm.com/downloads

1.2-Install Webstorm from https://www.jetbrains.com/student/4
  (Webstorm is an IDE for JavaScript. It supports JavaScript, TypeScript, HTML, CSS. It also supports frameworks such as React, Angular, and Vue.js )

1.3- Once you have both GitHub and Webstorm downloaded you must connect Github to Webstorm. To do so you will need to Go to Webstorm's system preferences and add the GitHub path. 

As you have your GitHub and Webstorm setup, we can move on to the next step, creating a repository. A repository is basically a place where you organize a project. 

Task 2
2.1- Create a new repository:
      - click the + in the upper right corner
      - name your repository 
      - Select 'Initialize this repository with a README'. (A 'README' is a file with information on your project. By intializing with a 'README', it immediately git clones the repository. )
      -Click 'create repository'

Saved changes on GitHub are called commits. These messages allows understanding of what was changed. Changes are then pushed into the commits  To do so:

Task 3
3.1- To change commits:
      - CLick the README.md file
      - Click on the pencil icon
      - Write the changes that you may need
      - Click 'commit changes'
      
When working on different versions of a repository at one time, you use branch.

Task 4:
4.1- Create a Branch:
    - Go to the repository
    - Click on 'branch: master' on the drop down at the top of the file, and type in branch name, readme edits in the the branch text box
    - Click 'create branch' or hit 'Enter'

A remote in used as a form of collaboration. It is used to exchange changes on platforms such as GitHub. 

A Pull request is used when changes are made and requested to be reviewed and used in branches. 

Task 5:
5.1- Pull request:
    - Click on 'pull request' tab and click 'new pull request'
    - In 'example comparisons' select the branch made to compare and make the changes
    - Submit by clicking 'create pull request'
5.2- Merge:
    (Merge is used to merge changes to the master branch)
    - To merge Pull request, click 'merge pull request'  and then 'confirm merge'.
    - Sometimes there maybe a merge conflict. This may occur when there is a change in one file that may conflict with another file and git is not sure which of the versions to use. This must be fixed manually and let the git know which one to use. 
    
Another feature used is Fetch. It maybe similar to Pull, but there are differences:

-fetch downloads changes from remote to the local repository, whereas pull downloads the changes and merges them to the current branch.
